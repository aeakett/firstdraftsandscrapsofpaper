[1-15] This tale cast a long shadow in Gary’s imagination. Although the lich monster in Dungeons & Dragons would certainly be inspired by [Ambrose Bierce’s “The Death of Halpin Frayser”](https://archive.org/stream/collectedworksa16biergoog#page/n12/mode/2up) and [Koschei the Deathless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_Koschei_the_Deathless) in Slavic folklore, it is virtually certain that the original inspiration was this deathly, deathless wizard [Xaltotun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xaltotun), High Priest of Set.

[9-19] Different Worlds #3. 

[9-20] A brief summary of anecdotes will give an idea of the difficulties inherent in trying to write a cohesive history of the creation of Dungeons & Dragons. In Alarums & Excursions #2 (1975), Gary said “20 or so” handwritten pages. In The Dragon #7 (1977), he said “ 18 or so.” In the Lord of the Green Dragons blog, Rob Kuntz, likely with the clearest recollection, said “16 pages of [typed] notes” (2009). And due to various circumstances, anyone who knows where the actual notes are now — if they are not irretrievably lost! — isn’t saying anything just yet.

The minor trick in determining the contents of Castle Greyhawk is in locating mentioned room descriptions; but the major trick involves a chronological understanding of all the various iterations.
