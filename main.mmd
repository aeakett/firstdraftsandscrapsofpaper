 - How collectors, copyright and the ephemeral nature of our hobby are contributing to the loss of our sub-cultural heritage.

# Intro
 -scholarship just beginning to start
  -peterson
  -documentaries
 -primary sources literally dying off
 -lots of popular material exists (print and pdf)
  -semi-popular material becoming easier to obtain because publishers starting to re-issue back catalogues as PDF
  -very early ephemeral material very hard to obtain
  -domesday book for example
   -a few issues held by libraries [atkatkatk], and while other issues are extant [atkatkatk] they are held privately and essentially inaccessable
   -none that I know of are widely available (except for a few cover scans on the acaeum)

# percieved value
 -Arneson collection almost lost
 -plagmada

# collectors
 -centralization
 -value escalation
 -do collectors have appropriate insurance?
  -monetary insurance is one thing... practical insurance is another.
  -there was a story about a colletor scanning his rare items for his own reference before selling them off

# copyright
 -archive.org takedown of magazines
 -sympathetic to creators
  -creators have a moral responsability

# conclusion
 -call for civil disobedience

It Belongs in a Museum!
 -a few special collections
  -toronto
  -whoever holds the domesday book issues
  -the Strong
 -Peterson did the right thing by putting the dalhun manuscript in the Strong
 -do libraries/museums value?
