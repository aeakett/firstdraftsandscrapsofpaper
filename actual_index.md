A while back I wrote a little rant about how the history of RPGs is disappearing and posted here, because that was easy. Since then, I've used this as a space to put up stuff that I want a permanent home for.

There's nothing fancy here. It's mostly just walls of text (of varying sizes):

- [My original rant](firstdraftsandscrapsofpaper.htm)
- Some seminar/podcast notes
  - [Horror in RPGs - PaizoCon 2013](horror_in_rpgs_links.htm)
  - [Horror in RPGs - PaizoCon 2014](horror_in_rpgs_links-2014.htm)
  - [Creating Pulp Adventure - PaizoCon 2014](creating_pulp_adventure_seminar_links-2014.htm)
- The text of various reccomended reading lists:
  - [Appendix N](appendix_n.htm)
  - ["Inspirational Source Material" from the Moldvay basic set](inspirational_source_material-moldvay.htm)
  - Appendix C from Master of the Game by Gary Gygax
  - Recommended Literature, Reference, Music, and Films from the GameMastery Guide
