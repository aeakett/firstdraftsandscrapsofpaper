Regarding Reasonable Availability
=================================

"Reasonably available"... that sounds pretty vague doesn't it? The truth is that I'm not completely clear on what that means myself. In general though, it should mean that a work is in print and available for purchase at a reasonable (there's that word again) price.

- new from the primary source or licensee
- cost at or below the initial MSRP (adjusted for inflation)
- electronic copies of works should be cheaper, but many variables contribute to that cost
   - generated from existing digital files? <$
   - scan of old physical copy (when digital source files do not exist)? >$ (amount dependant on quality of scan)
   - scan is OCR'd? >$ (amount dependant on quality of OCR)
   - bookmarks in supporting formats? >$
   - intra-document links in supporting formats? >$
