<h1>You&rsquo;re Not Broken, You&rsquo; Sick</h1>
<p>If you break your arm, you get the bone set and a cast. If you have a heart condition, you make some lifestyle changes and go on the appropriate medication. If you have cancer, you go through the appropriate treatment, draw your friends and family close for support, and fight like a son-of-a-bitch. So if you&rsquo;re depressed, anxious, have trouble concentrating, or whatever, go see a doctor. You&rsquo;re not broken, you&rsquo;re sick.</p>
<p>If you know somebody that says that they&rsquo;re having a hard time, remember that just because they seem functional doesn&rsquo;t mean that they aren&rsquo;t struggling <em>really</em> hard. If you have the emotional bandwidth to offer them some support, do it. They&rsquo;re not broken, they&rsquo;re sick.</p>

<h2>Finding Help</h2>
